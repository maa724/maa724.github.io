## Self Introduction
My name is Martina Albin. Currently, I am a junior at Lehigh University studying journalism and psychology. This is my page for my data journalism class.
As a journalism major, I am very much interested in communications, media, and writing. With psychology, I am interested with the different ways psychology in how different forms and media can influence individuals. I am currently a student reporter for my university's newspaper, [Brown & White page](https://thebrownandwhite.com/author/maa724/), where I have written a couple of articles in the last year; I have wrote about various topics ranging from the college town of Bethlehem, to student life.  Additionally, for a year I worked as a freelance writer for a social media company, Tree Frog Social; I wrote about different pop culture and social media topics. This past summer, I had an internship with Sant Jordi Hostels in Barcelona where I wrote articles about traveling and exploring Barcelona for the [company's blog](https://www.santjordihostels.com/blog/).

The data originates from Lehigh University's website for the 2021 admission cycle. The data demonstrates that most people who enroll as an undergraduate and as a graduate student tend to fall under arts & sciences, business, and engineering. One of the main differences from is graduate students have an education program, that many of the enroll students fell under. However, as seen on both pie charts, Lehigh does have a variety of people mixed into their different schools.
